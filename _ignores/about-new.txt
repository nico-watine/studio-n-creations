My name is Nico Watine, and I am the Studio N Creations team. I design, code and maintain mobile-optimized websites for projects of all sizes.

Having a professional website is key to a company’s image and success, and that’s exactly what I specialize in — strong websites for B2B and B2C small businesses. While I used to do full-stack web development full time, I now offer my services as a part-time freelance web designer. I only take on 1 or 2 projects at a time to ensure I can provide the utmost excellence in service and quality with every job, for every client.

I’m located in Houston, TX, and am available for hire anywhere. Please contact me and let’s see when we can get started — I’m only a message away.
