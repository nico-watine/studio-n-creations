# Studio N Creations site repo

### This is highly customized workflow for the development of this site. It requires a Macintosh computer, running the programs [Codekit 3](https://incident57.com/codekit/index.html), [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) and [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/). 

### It is built on my [zurb-f6-boilerplate](https://github.com/nico-watine/zurb-f6-boilerplate)

#### **FEATURES**

* [Foundation 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/) Framework (inherently awesome) 

* Cache-busting auto-versioning for CSS and JS [(CREDIT)](http://www.particletree.com/notebook/automatically-version-your-css-and-javascript-files/)

* Easy SASS and JS compilation tools with a nice GUI ([Codekit App](https://incident57.com/codekit/index.html))

* Optimized Google Analytics tracking code ([CREDIT](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/pull/1660#issuecomment-89815017))

* Can process PHP files (not just HTML)
