					<p>Having a professional website is key to a company’s image and success, and that’s exactly what I specialize in — strong websites for B2B and B2C small businesses. While I used to do full-stack web development full time, I now offer my services as a part-time freelance web designer. I only take on 1 or 2 projects at a time to ensure I can provide the utmost excellence in service and quality with every job, for every client.</p>
					<p>I’m located in Houston, TX, and am available for hire anywhere. Please contact me and let’s see when we can get started — I’m only a message away.</p>
